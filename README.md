# EDA-Suagrcane-Production
This exploratory data analysis (EDA) project focuses on examining sugarcane production data. Through this analysis, we seek to gain valuable insights into factors influencing sugarcane production, develop predictive models for future yields, and ultimately support efforts to optimize production efficiency and sustainability.
